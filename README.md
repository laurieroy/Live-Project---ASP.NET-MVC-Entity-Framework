Live project was an opportunity to use scrum methodology to work on real projects. During the two week-long sprints, I worked on a podcast project and a blog project.

The first sprint was a team of three making some updates to the Tech Academy site's podcast pages. This was great exposure to reading existing code, and blending my changes with it. Some changes were to formatting, such as changing borders, colors or adding a button and moving a link. Others were more structural such as on pressing play, the media jumped to the other side of the page. This took some diving into the logic and seeing what needed to be rearranged. It was also my first time dealing with merge conflicts from working in team environment. 

The second week was a short week due to holidays, but was fun in an entirely different way. First was the challenge of getting TFS to work on this project. I worked on some issues with the blog page that was being drastically redesigned. I moved create blogposts from a page to the navbar, adjusted the horizontal layout, and some formatting.
